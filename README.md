# Greenify

A React app that allows will Greenify your life! Rent your pot plants out to a loving community, or search for a new pot plant to join your home for a while.

The website model is based on a renting system, where a user can opt to either be a rentee, or a renter.

A rentee can...
- Post their plants that they would like to rent out, including uploading an image, and setting the dates that the plant is available for.
- Browse other peoples plants, and rent out their plants if they wish!

A renter can...
- Browse the plant page, searching for specific breeds or simply searching all the plants up for rent!
- Make a booking for a plant when they find one they like. This booking can only be made within the dates that the rentee has chosen.

## Database Structure

The site is using the API backend (which can be found here)[https://lucyod10.github.io/greenify-client/#/] which was made in rails.
